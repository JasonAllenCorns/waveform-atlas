## Session 1: Session Diary Setup

**What we are working on:**
- Establishing a structured session diary for the project.
- The diary will log work done, lessons learned, and next steps for each session.

**What we tried and did:**
- Decided on the diary structure and its purposes.
- Initiated creation of the '_changelog' directory and the session diary markdown file.

**What was learned:**
- Maintaining a session diary will help with continuity, collaboration, and requirements/test cataloging.
- The diary will be updated after each session turn.

**What we will do next:**
- Update this diary with each turn, summarizing actions, learnings, and next steps.
- Use the diary to inform requirements and test planning at the end of the project.
